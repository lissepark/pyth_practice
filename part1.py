''' Exercise 1.10.3.1. Write a version, add3.py, that asks for three numbers, and lists all three, and
their sum, in similar format to the example above.'''

print('The third integer is:', c)
print('The sum of',a,'and',b,'and',c,'is:', a+b+c)

'''Exercise 1.10.3.2. a. Write a program, quotient.py, that prompts the user for two integers, and
then prints them out in a sentence with an integer division problem like "The quotient of 14 and 3 is
4 with a remainder of 2".'''
